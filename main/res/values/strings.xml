    <p><b>Research</b></p>

    <p>In downloading and using this application, you are participating in a research study. This research is being conducted by ECE 32, a Senior Design Group at Drexel University. The members of this group include Forest Oden, Steven Kravitsky, Lherisson Medina, and Stephany Rosa. The application will securely pass your location information (which you consented to provide before downloading the app) to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 database to be analyzed.</p>

    <p><b>Purposes of the research</b></p>

    <p>This research is being conducted to train a machine learning algorithm for ECE 32’s Senior Design Project. This algorithm is designed to make predictions based on the data collected from your usage of this app.</p>

    <p><b>Expected duration of the subject’s participation</b></p>

    <p>You, the subject, can discontinue use of the application at any time. The active research period will end May 31st, 2017; however, data will be collected indefinitely as long as the application is installed on your mobile device.</p>

    <p><b>Procedures to be followed</b></p>

    <p>If you would no longer like your location data to be collected by the application, visit the Settings page, and disable the “Track Trips?” option.</p>

    <p>If you would like to delete the already collected data, visit the Settings page and choose the “Delete Trip Information” option.</p>

    <p>If you have any issues with the above procedures, see below to contact the team.</p>

    <p><b>Contacting us for questions, concerns, complaints, or to obtain information</b></p>

    <p>The team can be contacted through the application’s page in the Google Play Store, or through the form located in the application itself.</p>
